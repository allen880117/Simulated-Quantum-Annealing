[!][X] sqa-qmc.xclbin 
    -> copysignf won't work

[+][V] sqa-qmc.2.xclbin
    -> works well
    -> i/o latency of HBM is too long
        -> need more HBM

[+][V] sqa-qmc.3.xclbin
    -> [V] Use more HBM to reduce the i/o latency 

[+][V] sqa-qmc.4.xclbin
    -> [V] pass AM test
    -> [V] better latency by merging the usage of fadd between different trotter units
        -> Fully merge "All TU" into one pipeline
    
[+][V] sqa-qmc.5.xclbin
    -> [*] Based on qmc_u50.2.backup.cpp
    -> [V] use Sign function for better resource usage (LUT)
    
[+][V] sqa-qmc.6.xclbin
    -> [*] Based on qmc_u50.5.backup.cpp
    -> [V] use less stream for better throughput and lut usage
        -> Less NUM_STREAM make less control logic
    -> [V] Better host-kernel I/O Latency
        -> Remove if-branch of READ_JCOUP which enable the "request" lapping with other works
        -> [:)] Schedule Viewer explains everything.
        -> I/O Latency becomes from 12ms to 3ms
    -> [V] Better resoure-sharing
        -> Move "LOOP_STEP" into each TU
        -> Merge "Request" in one TU but not merge "all TU" into one pipeline 
    -> [*] If we can solve the data dependency of TU0, we can achieve higher parallelism
