    -> copysignf won't work

[+][V] sqa-qmc.2.xclbin
    -> works well
    -> i/o latency of HBM is too long
        -> need more HBM

[+][V] sqa-qmc.3.xclbin
    -> [V] Use more HBM to reduce the i/o latency 

[+][V] sqa-qmc.4.xclbin
    -> [V] pass AM test
    -> [V] better latency by merging the usage of fadd between different trotter units
